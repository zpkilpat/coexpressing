# coexpressing
Reinforcement learning circuit model with co-expressing dopamine-glutamate neurons under reward/shock/knockout conditions.

We extended the classic temporal-difference learning framework for classical conditioning to incorporate co-expressing neural populations with slow synapses triggering an action selecting population. Evolution equations for our neural circuit model incorporate a population of pure dopamine expressing neurons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and a co-expressing population that releases glutamate and dopamine. These are each driven by the stimulus and feedback. Code evolves across multiple "days" leading to weight learning, and we repeat 10 different experiments to mimic data collection from multiple animals as in experiments from companion paper.
